- 👋 Hi, I’m @tangjiqiong
- 👀 I’m an international student pursuing my master degree at UC San Diego and expected to graduate on Dec. 2022
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathmatical finance and looking for full-time jobs as data analyst
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytical, data visualization projects or interview preparation
- 📫 Please reach me at tang.jiqiong@gmail.com


To briefly introduce the case, I’m supposed to be the entry-level data analyst at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices, which could help guide marketing strategies.

In this project, I am going to analyze the lifestyle patterns of 33 users based on some health-oriented metrics and relationships among weight, workout activeness, and sleep quality to enhance stakeholders’ understanding of key business issues. Also, I use Tableau to visualize the findings and actionale solutions for product enhancement.
